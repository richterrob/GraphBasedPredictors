R functions to compute graph based predictors (GBPs) as baselines for causal structural learning as proposed in the paper RSS23:

- The function oip.R computes observed indegree predictors in all it four forms (OIP, T-OIP, P-OIP and P-T-OIP);
- The function tap.R computes the transitivity assuming predictor (TAP) or its realted q-TAP by Algorithm 1 of [RSS23];
- The function btap.R computes the biased version of the TAP and q-TAP given by Algorithm 2 of [RSS23].

The remaining functions are needed as subroutines.
